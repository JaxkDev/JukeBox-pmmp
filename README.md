# JukeBox-pmmp

A small plugin that implements the Jukebox and Records untill its in the core of pmmp !

#### IMPORTANT INFO:
>**For this plugin to function as intended, all mobile device users must download the 90mb DLC 'Music' free from the store in game (It is a one time download).**
>*(Please do not make issues saying theres no sound, there is but you have to have the dlc)*

## Special Thanks:
_Thanks to the below for helping me testing in private, your help was massively appreciated._

## Todo:

- [x] JukeBox block
- [x] Record Items
- [x] Sound playing
- [x] Popup "Now Playing X"
- [ ] Even more config options
- [ ] Custom record names (so resource packs can modify the sound)
- [x] Save and Read state (when server restarts records remain in jukebox)
