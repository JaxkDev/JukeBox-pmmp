# JukeBox-pmmp

A small plugin that implements the Jukebox and Records untill its in the core of pmmp !

#### IMPORTANT INFO:
>**For this plugin to function as intended, all mobile device users must download the 90mb DLC 'Music' free from the store in game (It is a one time download).**
>*(Please do not make issues saying theres no sound, there is but you have to have the dlc)*
